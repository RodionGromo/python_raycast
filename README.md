## What is this, exactly?
This is a raycasting test, the one used in old games like Doom<br>
I had a good time trying to figure out what does what, but in the end it was worth it!
## How to run it?
You will need:
- Python >3.8
- pygame >2.1.2
- some single core processor power
- patience

Just run the `main.py` file, and enjoy the raycasting that first games were based upon<br>
## What is this cfg.txt?
`cfg.txt` is a config file, in which you can change some things related to raycast and resolution
- `gameMode` is setting game mode: `1` is first person, `0` is top view
- `GMScreenH` (and `GMScreenW`) controls resolution in first person mode
- `MMScreenH` (and `MMScreenW`) controls resolution in top view mode
- `fov` is, field of view, in degrees
- `density` is rays per degree, units: idk
- `maxRange` is maximum ray distance, units: idk again

## Will there be updates?
Yes, but I don't know how much time I can put into this, but I'm going to evolve this into some kind of game (shooter perhaps?)
## End
And that's it! Have fun!
